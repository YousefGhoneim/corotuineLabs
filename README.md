Kotlin Coroutines Lab

This project demonstrates core coroutine concepts in Kotlin using MVVM-style structure. It includes examples of `Flow`, `SharedFlow`, `StateFlow`, and `Channel`.

Topics Covered

- `Flow` and flow operators (`map`, `filter`)
- `SharedFlow` with buffer handling
- `StateFlow` and live data streaming
- `Channel` and `produce-consume` pattern
- Coroutine builders: `launch`, `coroutineScope`, `runBlocking`

##  Tech Stack

- Kotlin
- Coroutines
- Flow API
- Clean structure for educational purposes
